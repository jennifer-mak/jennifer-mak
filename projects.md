Here are the main projects I worked on throughout my time in grad school. 

## **AREEN: AR-EEG Neglect Detection System for Patients with Stroke**
After having a stroke, roughly 1/3 of patients will experience a syndrome called spatial neglect. This is an attention disorder that's characterized by the inability to attend to contralesional stimuli. For example, if there is some visual stimulus to the left of a patient with neglect after a right hemisphere stroke, they may be unable to perceive it and respond to it. This is a complicated syndrome that is currently diagnosed with pen-and-paper or behavioral tests. However, these tests have many shortcomings, such as lack of compensation for head and trunk movements, quantitative metrics, and specificity. Thus, our goal was to combine a neuroimaging modality with a behavioral assessment to identify neural biomarkers of neglect to improve its diagnosis and assessment.
