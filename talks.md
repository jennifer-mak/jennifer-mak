## **Neural Control of Movement 2024**
This April, I'll be giving a talk at the annual Neural Control of Movement meeting in Dubrovnik, Croatia! I'll be on a panel on the underlying mechanisms of motor impairments after stroke, discussing updates on my work that I first showed at SfN 2023.

## **_Where does your journey STEM from? with Dr. Carina Minardi_**
In November 2023, I had the pleasure of speaking to Dr. Minardi on her podcast after a surprise LinkedIn connection. I spoke about my fascination in the natural world that sparked from childhood, my experimental research experiences that grew from middle and high school science fairs, how I decided to go for a PhD, and thoughts on neurotech accessibility.

## **Society for Neuroscience 2023**
I gave my first ever podium talk at a conference in November 2023 at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting. At this nanosymposium on "Imaging and Assessment of Stroke Damage", I discussed my results in using TMS to investigate connectivity changes in stroke patients and their impact on reaching behavior.

## **How to Prelim**
RNEL hosts monthly Professional and Technical Development seminars and every January, we give an informational session to first- and second-year PhD students in the Bioengineering program, particularly for those on the Neural Engineering track, on how to prepare for the PhD preliminary exam. We provide an overview of the exam, tips and tricks for the written and oral components, and general advice from those who had successfully completed this stage of their PhD.
