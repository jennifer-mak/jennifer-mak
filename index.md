## About Me

Welcome to my page! I am currently in my fifth year of my PhD in Bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh where I am a member of the Rehab Neural Engineering Labs (RNEL) under Dr. George Wittenberg. My thesis work is on understanding the brain mechanisms involved in the attention (spatial neglect) and motor (upper limb hemiparesis) deficits after stroke, and building technology-driven methods for improving stroke rehabilitation. 

Outside of research, I am also deeply passionate about increasing access to STEM education, especially for women and historically marginalized populations, which has spurred my service work at Pitt and in the Greater Pittsburgh community. In my free time, I am an avid rock climber, hiker, and crocheter.

## Leadership
- **Founding an undergraduate summer research program at RNEL.** In 2020, RNEL established a set of outreach committees dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion. I took up leadership of the undergraduate outreach group under the mission of 1) hiring diverse undergrads, especially those from underserved communities with fewer opportunities to have research experiences, 2) re-evaluating the way applicants were considered to account for disadvantaged backgrounds, and 3) structuring the summer research months such that students received a quality experience with measureable outcomes. To accomplish this:
  - I presented our research opportunities and gave an introduction to neural engineering to undergrads at local universities (Point Park University, Community College of Allegheny County) and the local chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE).
  - We additionally evaluated applications based on need, as defined by the availability of neural engineering opportunities at the home institution.
  - I designed two grad-student-run workshops per summer (technical and professional development) as well as hosted the weekly undergrad journal club. In addition to completing their individual research projects with their faculty advisors, these workshops and journal clubs provided supplemental education and skills in a friendly, low-stakes environment. Students completed the summer with an oral presentation to the whole lab and an abstract submission to the Biomedical Engineering Society conference and/or Pitt's undergrad engineering publication _Ingenium_.
