## About Me

Welcome to my page! I am currently in my fifth year of my PhD in Bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh where I am a member of the Rehab Neural Engineering Labs under Dr. George Wittenberg. My thesis work is on understanding the brain mechanisms involved in the attention (spatial neglect) and motor (upper limb hemiparesis) deficits after stroke, and building technology-driven methods for improving stroke rehabilitation. Outside of research, I am also deeply passionate about increasing access to STEM education, especially for women and historically marginalized populations, which has spurred my service work at Pitt and in the Greater Pittsburgh community. 

## Education
- **University of Pittsburgh -** PhD, Bioengineering (2019-2024, coming soon!)
- **Virginia Commonwealth University -** BS, Biomedical Engineering (2015-2019)

## Research Interests

- **Neurorehabiliation:** stroke recovery, mechanisms of brain injury, neuromodulation
- **Neurotechnology:** EEG, TMS, brain-computer interfaces, MRI, robotics
- **Biosignals:** brain connectivity, time/frequency analyses, kinematic analysis
- **Medical device development:** design controls, human factors engineering, product commercialization
